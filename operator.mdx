## VPN Profile

To start using the VPN after it's deployed, download the VPN profile. You can download the profile from the [Azure Console](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/point-to-site-vpn-client-cert-windows#azure-portal) or using [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/point-to-site-vpn-client-cert-windows#powershell).

### Azure Console

1. In the Azure portal, go to the virtual network gateway for the virtual network to which you want to connect.

2. On the virtual network gateway page, select Point-to-site configuration to open the Point-to-site configuration page.

3. At the top of the Point-to-site configuration page, select Download VPN client. This doesn't download VPN client software, it generates the configuration package used to configure VPN clients. It takes a few minutes for the client configuration package to generate. During this time, you may not see any indications until the packet has generated.

### PowerShell

```powershell
$profile=New-AzVpnClientConfiguration -ResourceGroupName "local-dev-vnet-0001" -Name "local-dev-vpn-0001" -AuthenticationMethod "EapTls"

$profile.VPNProfileSASUrl
```

- `ResourceGroupName` is the resource group of the virtual network (copy package name from your VNet bundle)
- `Name` is the name of the virtual network gateway (copy package name from your VPN bundle)
